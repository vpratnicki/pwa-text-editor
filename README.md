# PWA Text Editor

## Description

This app is a single-page text editor that meets the PWA criteria. Users can add code snippets with or without an internet connection and their code is stored for later user. To build this text editor, I started with an existing application and implemented methods for getting and storing data to an IndexedDB database. This app uses a service worker and cache API's so that the app is fully functional even if the internet connection is lost.
